# resolve-thread.sh — Resolve the active workstream thread from pwd (Claude Code).
#
# Walks up from $PWD looking for an internOS workstream directory of the form
# <workspace>/projects/<project-or-container/...>/<project>/workstreams/<workstream>/.
# If found, verifies that BRIEF.md exists and its thread_id matches the
# expected canonical form
# `claude-code:projects/<path-to-project>/workstreams/<workstream>`.
#
# This is the Claude Code analogue of the Discord/Slack thread_id binding:
# the working directory IS the thread. Resolution is exact and deterministic —
# no fuzzy matching, no fallback, no guessing.
#
# Usage:
#   resolve-thread.sh                       # uses $PWD and $INTERNOS_WORKSPACE
#   resolve-thread.sh <pwd> [<workspace>]   # explicit args (testing)
#
# Env:
#   INTERNOS_WORKSPACE  One or more roots (REQUIRED — no default). PATH-style:
#                       colon-separated list. Each root is EITHER a single
#                       workspace (directly contains `projects/`) OR a
#                       workspaces container (its immediate children each
#                       contain `projects/`, canonically named "workspaces").
#                       Containers are expanded to their child workspaces;
#                       resolution then picks the first workspace that is an
#                       ancestor of $PWD.
#
#                       Single workspace:
#                           export INTERNOS_WORKSPACE="$HOME/workspaces/frutero"
#                       Several workspaces, explicit:
#                           export INTERNOS_WORKSPACE="$HOME/workspaces/frutero:$HOME/workspaces/poktalabs"
#                       Workspaces container (resolves across every child):
#                           export INTERNOS_WORKSPACE="$HOME/workspaces"
#
# Output (stdout, on success): absolute path to the active workstream directory
# Exit codes:
#   0  active workstream resolved (path printed to stdout)
#   1  pwd is not inside a workstream subtree (no active thread — silent, expected)
#   2  workstream directory found but BRIEF.md missing or thread_id mismatched
#   3  usage error (missing INTERNOS_WORKSPACE, bad start dir, etc.)

resolve-thread: INTERNOS_WORKSPACE is not set.

Set it to one or more workspace roots (each containing a `projects/` directory).
PATH-style: colon-separated. Examples:

    export INTERNOS_WORKSPACE="$HOME/workspaces/frutero"
    export INTERNOS_WORKSPACE="$HOME/workspaces/frutero:$HOME/workspaces/poktalabs"

There is no implicit default — the Claude Code adapter requires this to be
explicit so it never silently picks up a stale or unrelated workspace.

# Resolution accepts two binding forms:

#      The workstream is "owned" by Claude Code; thread_id is canonical.
#
#   2. Dual binding — `thread_id` belongs to another platform (Slack, Discord,
#      Telegram, etc.) where humans collaborate, and a sibling field
#      `thread_id_claude_code: claude-code:projects/<p>/workstreams/<w>`
#      anchors the Claude Code adapter. Used when one workstream spans a
#      human-comms surface and an agent-ops surface.
#
# Either field matching the canonical `claude-code:` form for this directory
# is a successful bind. The framework spec (COMMUNICATION.md) only requires
# a single `thread_id`; `thread_id_claude_code` is this adapter's escape
# hatch for cross-platform workstreams.
